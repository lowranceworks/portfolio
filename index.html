      <p>
        <b>Ronny Flaatten ¬∑ CTIntegrations Founder</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Josh is an incredibly talented engineer, the speed at which he not only learns but master new technologies is
        impressive. His work ethic is outstanding, and he always delivers! We were in a transformation as a software
        company and required the team to wear many hats and be able to adapt to new technologies quickly; Josh was an
        essential part of this transformation, and he never wavered.
      </p>


      <p>
        <b>Jeff Hunt ¬∑ Director of IT at Quik!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't say enough good things about Josh. He's driven, positive and committed. He brightens up a room when he
        walks in and stays focused approaching any situation or problem. He keeps an open mind when troubleshooting and
        tries to look at things from different angles when stuck, which leads to unique and inventive solutions. It was
        an absolute pleasure working with Josh and any company would be improved having him on their payroll.

      <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects</h2>
      <h3>Linux workstation configuration with Ansible</h3>
      <p>
        I've created an Ansible playbook that configures a new installation of Linux desktop (Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora).
        This is currently under a private repository, but I intend to make it public and share it with others to
        encourage Software/DevOps engineers to switch to a Linux workstation.

      <h3>Portfolio website</h3>
      <p>
        A 3D portfolio website written with Typescript, CSS and HTML hosted on Github pages.
